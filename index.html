            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp; I am <b>Filip</b>!
                I am most motivated to work in programming by the opportunity to creatively solve problems
                and develop applications for a specific purpose. I also derive satisfaction from the opportunity for
                continuous development and the awareness that I can always learn more, do something better. Currently,
                after solidly understanding the <b>Java</b> basics,</br> I am learning <b>Scala</b>, <b>Springboot</b> and related technologies. I would
                like to start my path in the IT industry while I'm in college to focus even more on the practical
                aspects of programming and business operations.

                        <h3>Piano</h3>
                        <p>
                            Music has always been the huge part of my life.</br> I have been playing the piano since I was six years old.
                            In 2021 I graduated  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SzkolaMuzycznaImtSzeligowskiegoWGorzowieWlkp">2nd grade music school</a> with the piano as the main instrument of mine.
                            This beautiful experience taught me how to stay focused and learn systematically.
                            Nowadays piano helps me to relax and meditate.

                        <h3>Folk Dance</h3>
                        <p>
                            I danced in a <a href="https://www.maligorzowiacy.pl/">folk group</a> for 14 years. During that time I have participated in over 20 international dance festivals.
                            This gave me the capability of visiting a lot of different countries and as a result getting to know their cultures.
                            Thanks to it, I understood how to function in the multicultural community as well as to be the part of  the group
                            that has the common goal. Moreover, it sparked my curiosity about the world and my love of travel.
